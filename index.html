			<h3> Quick bio </h3>
		</div>
		<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> My name is Abhijeet Saha and I was born in Bangladesh on July 26, 2003.
			I immigrated here when I was 4 years old. I went to PS 106, 51, 33 and then I went to Lab Middle School. In Middle School I developed
			a deeper interest in math and joined math team and started doing math contests. I currently go to Stuyvesant High School and am in Math Team.
			My hobbies include doing math problems, solving coding problems, playing League of Legends, and staying up late to do my homework.
			I'm trying to cut down on that last hobby but it's a work in progress. At home you'll mainly catch me at my desk on my
			laptop all day long, maybe getting up to get food from the kitchen.
